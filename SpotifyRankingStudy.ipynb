    "# Introduction and Motivations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "To introduce the subject material and understand the motivations behind this study, we first recall our original project proposal:\n",
    ">As people who are like music and have received some form of musical training, we decided to do our data science topic on songs.  A look at the Spotify data obtained in Kaggle has shown lists of top ranking songs, some song classifications, and some attributes that are known as \"audio analyses.\"  Metrics such as \"danceability\" and \"energy\" are given quantitative values and are available through Spotify's API.  We intend to use this data as a data lake for our experiments in order to find out what Spotify looks for in a hit.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">We'd like to answer questions such as \"Given today's trends, what does it take to make it to Spotify's top 50 songs?\"  and \"What's more important for streaming numbers today, instrumentalness or danceability?\"  We add the qualifier for the present because at the moment we do not have access to such ranking data from 2016 or earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining the Question\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the unfamiliar, Spotify is a digital music, podcast, and video streaming service that provides access to more than 30 million songs.  Spotify's Charts rank songs by the number of streams - we obtained the top 100 songs of 2017 to conduct our analysis.  The dataset is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/nadintamer/top-tracks-of-2017/downloads/featuresdf.csv/1 \n",
    "\n",
    "As outlined in the proposal, we'd like to find out what makes up a Spotify hit.  Which of the audio features are the most important?  What gets more listens - vocals-based music like rap or instrumentals like EDM?  The potential significance of such questions are at least two-fold: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Develop some sort of model that could determine if a song's characteristics are enough to be a Spotify chart-topper\n",
    "2. Perhaps even reverse-engineer how Spotify determines these song attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we set up the environment:\n"

    "+ **energy**: \n",
    "    + measure from 0.0 to 1.0 which represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. \n",
